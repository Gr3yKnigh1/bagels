# Bagels

Bagels, a deductive logic game.

I am thinking of a 3-digit number. Try to guess what it is.
Here are some clues:
When I say:
* Pico -> One digit is correct but in the wrong position.
* Fermi -> One digit is correct and in the right position.
* Bagels -> No digit is correct.

I have thought up a number.
You have 10 guesses to get it.
